SDCC-INSTALL
============

This script helps to install the latest version of the SDCC compiler

Here are the list of Assumption that this script would make in order work:

 *   The installation is always in the directory '$HOME/local/SDCC'

 *   All files are downloaded into '$HOME/local'
 
 *   Before and after installation the non required directory and files are removed

In case the build fails additional dependencies need to installed manually.
